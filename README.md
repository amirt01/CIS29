# CIS29
All of these assignments were done for my CIS29 class at De Anza college.

## A Spell Checker
- http://voyager.deanza.edu/~bentley/cis29/ass1.html
This assignment is meant to be a review of some of the introductory concepts covered in CIS22B. It involves writing some classes, constructors, destructors, memory allocation, file I/O, and program planning. You are to use the two classes, Word and Dictionary, the suggested main() (or a main() that is very similar), the dictionary "word" file, and the input file, "gettysburg.txt".
## Maintaining a Highest Scores List
- http://voyager.deanza.edu/~bentley/cis29/ass2.html
The purpose of this assignment is to maintain a list of 10 highest scores for some game.  The assignment requires building and using two libraries and reading and writing a binary file.  The program will make use of an input file containing game scores.
## Binary Data and Multiple Inheritance
- http://voyager.deanza.edu/~bentley/cis29/ass3.html
This assignment will give you practice processing a binary file, manipulating binary data, using casts, and multiple inheritance.  The assignment has two parts - processing a binary file and working with the 12-class multiple  inheritance hierarchy shown below.  You should only turn in one (set of) source code that contains both parts.
## Spelling Checking
- http://voyager.deanza.edu/~bentley/cis29/ass4.html
The goal of this assignment is to give you practice in function and class templates and applying other concepts covered in the course.

You are to create a generic (class template) hash table. You will use this template to create a "Dictionary" of words. The words will be stored in a (library) class type that you will derive from string.  You will use your hash table Dictionary to spell check a document and perform some analysis of the efficiency of your hash table. 
## Get Rich Using The $TL
- http://voyager.deanza.edu/~bentley/cis29/ass5.html
The goal of this assignment is to give you practice using the Standard Template Library, to review the course concepts, and practice problem solving skills.

In this assignment, you have been hired by a financial advisor to analyze two mutual funds and produce reports that will aid in a recommendation to a customer.

NAV => Net Asset Value = the value of one share of a mutual fund on a particular date
## STL / Bitmaps / SFML / Lambda functions
- http://voyager.deanza.edu/~bentley/cis29/ass6.html
The goal of this assignment is to give you practice using the Standard Template Library, bitmaps, SFML, and lambda functions.  The assignment consists of reading a binary file, storing the data in a map of bitset, flipping bits, moving the data to a vector, loading the vector into an image, loading the image into a texture, using the texture to create a sprte, and displaying the sprite in a RenderWindow.  You will need to do some SFML research into how to create an image and how to work with type color Color.  Use the sample output as checks to make sure you are proceeding correctly.  Your output should look like that that shown below (including formatting).
